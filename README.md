# tera-data

This repository is intended to house data specific to TERA. By separating this
into its own module, it will be easier to check for updates as well as avoid
cluttering a parent project's repository with datafile commits.

It is intended to be platform agnostic, but JS parses are included for ease of
inclusion into a Node.js project.
